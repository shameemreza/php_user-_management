This User management with ,ogin and Admin panel has been built using PHP. You can use it for PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6 and PHP 7+. I added almost all the features I needed to built custom application using PHP. Even You can add or customization without any limitations.

I also tried to follow 100% coding standard into this script. THough it can be use as script but I will not call it script as Its just some code file to make user panel.
